# Machine Learning Practice
This repository contains the code and notes from my machine learning practice sessions guided by Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). The course covers various fundamental concepts of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and practical advice on applying machine learning to real-world problems.

## Overview
This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that I created while following Andrew Ng's machine learning videos. The content includes both theoretical exercises and practical implementations of algorithms using Python.

### Topics Covered:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines
- Unsupervised Learning (K-means clustering, PCA)
- Anomaly Detection

## Installation
To run the notebooks and scripts in this repository, you will need Python and Jupyter Notebook. You can install the necessary dependencies using the following steps:

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hritikraj8804/ml-practice.git
cd ml-practice
```
