* **Assignments:** Each assignment folder contains the code, datasets, and documentation.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the desired directory:**
    ```bash
    cd CNS/Assignment1
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    cd CD/LexicalAnalyzer
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    cd ML/Assignment1
    ```
3.  **Follow the instructions in the assignment's README or documentation.**

## Dependencies

Specific dependencies for each assignment are listed within the respective assignment directories. Generally, you may need:

* **Python 3.x:** For ML and some CNS assignments.
* **Java:** For CD assignments.
* **C/C++:** For some CNS and CD assignments.
* **Specific libraries:** Such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn (for ML), or network simulation tools (for CNS).

Please refer to the individual assignment's documentation for detailed dependency information.
